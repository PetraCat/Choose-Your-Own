<h1>Welp, The Bear Got You</h1>

    <p>
      Well, I did tell you about the bear did I not? After we split up I went looking for you but could not find you anywere. The only thing left were a number of foot steps and some large paw prints. In the end I found the treasure and can be now found floating on my yat in the gulf of Mexico. Shame you didn't get the tresure.
