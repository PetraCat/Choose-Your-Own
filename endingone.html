<h1>Its just ROCKS...</h1>

    <p>
      In the end I guess you are not the great at making decisions. We found a very neat and cute pile of rocks, any value to them not really. You go home with one of the rocks while I go home with the rest. I never speak to you again of course, although you see a news article about me in the newspaper. It says "Mad Woman Holding Rocks with Googly Eyes is taken in by police after asking others to talk to her baby rocks." Lets just say this is not a happy ending for any of us.
