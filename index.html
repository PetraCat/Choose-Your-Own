      Hello! Welcome to a new somewhat experimentive adventure of sorts. Very easy quick TUTORIAL so listen up! What you need to do to follow the story is watch the video that is before you. As soon as you are done watching it you will find two links, those are your choices, click on one and you will be directed to the next step. And thats it!
