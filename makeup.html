<h1>Wow...Thanks?</h1>

      Well she did know how to pick them... In case you are un aware of what you know hold in your hands, the parcel the witch gave you is not good news. It is filled with tons of canceled make up tainted by the mistakes and poor choices of their creators. It is too great of a weight to hold on to items like these so you are un able to sell them and are doomed to hold on to it till you, well die. These will be passed down from generation to generation. What a burden. You are tho given the ability to make very beautiful make up looks but they cannot be seen by the world. Pity.
